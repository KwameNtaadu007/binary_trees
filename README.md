# Binary Tree Overview

This project focuses on understanding binary trees and binary search trees (BSTs), including their properties, traversal methods, and different types. It explores the potential time complexity gain compared to linked lists and provides an explanation of depth, height, and size of a binary tree.

## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected through edges. Each node has, at most, two child nodes - a left child and a right child. Nodes with no children are known as leaf nodes. Binary trees provide efficient data organization for tasks such as searching, insertion, and deletion.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

A Binary Search Tree is a special type of binary tree where the left child of a node contains a value less than or equal to the node's value, and the right child contains a value greater than the node's value. This property ensures efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with an average time complexity of O(log n) for balanced trees.

## Time Complexity Gain Compared to Linked Lists

The main advantage of binary trees over linked lists is the improved time complexity for certain operations. In linked lists, searching, insertion, and deletion typically require O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements. In balanced binary search trees, these operations have an average time complexity of O(log n), making them more efficient for large datasets.

## Depth, Height, and Size of a Binary Tree

- **Depth:** The depth of a node in a binary tree represents the number of edges from the root to that node. The root node has a depth of 0.

- **Height:** The height of a binary tree is the maximum depth among all nodes in the tree. It represents the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node.

- **Size:** The size of a binary tree refers to the total number of nodes present in the tree.

## Traversal Methods for Binary Trees

There are three main traversal methods to navigate through binary trees:

1. **In-order Traversal:** In-order traversal visits nodes in ascending order in a BST. For a general binary tree, it visits the left subtree, then the current node, and finally the right subtree.

2. **Pre-order Traversal:** Pre-order traversal visits the current node before its children. For a general binary tree, it visits the current node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

3. **Post-order Traversal:** Post-order traversal visits the current node after its children. For a general binary tree, it visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the current node.

## Types of Binary Trees

- **Complete Binary Tree:** A complete binary tree is a binary tree where all levels, except possibly the last one, are completely filled, and the last level is filled from left to right.

- **Full Binary Tree:** A full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes have either 0 or 2 children.

- **Perfect Binary Tree:** A perfect binary tree is both a complete binary tree and a full binary tree, where all internal nodes have two children, and all leaves are at the same level.

- **Balanced Binary Tree:** A balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the heights of the two subtrees of every node differ by no more than one. It ensures that operations have a time complexity of O(log n) in average cases.

## Conclusion

Understanding binary trees and their variations, such as binary search trees and different types of binary trees, is crucial in developing efficient algorithms for various tasks. The traversal methods help navigate and process binary trees effectively. Being able to distinguish between complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees aids in choosing the appropriate data structure for different applications.
